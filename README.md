I choose Julia language because:
- Julia is new and trending. I am awlays open to new cool stuff:)
- Julia is fast(At least it's advertised so)
- Julia is similar dynamically typed, scripting like, means easy to learn

## Running Instruction
First you need to install Julia
On MacOS, you can install Julia via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```shell
brew install julia
```
To run Julia script
```shell
julia script_name.jl
```
(Note: If you find GUI window close quickly, add -i argument to open an backend Julia session.)
